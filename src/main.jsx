/* 25) in index.html: <div id="root"></div> you take that box and say: 
  make this the root of my React app (=createRoot)
  Whatever you put in render(...), shows up on the page.
  26) Strictmode is like training wheels for react: catches issues and steers things.
  27) RouterProvider is the brains of the router: it takes the router (createBrowserRouter) 
  and makes it work. Without this, React wouldnâ€™t know how to handle URLs like /about or /projects
